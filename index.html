          <h2>About this project</h2>
          <p class="lead">The Pacific Forestry Centre (PFC) is a Canadian Forest Service research centre operating under Natural Resources Canada (NRCan). The goal of the Digital Resurrection of Historical Maps (DRHMAI) project is to develop an open-source framework or tool that converts scanned geo-referenced Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) files of hand-drawn, historical forest-cover maps into vectorized spatial data. This enables historic map data to be converted to modern, analysis-ready formats (e.g. geopackage) and stored in National Forest Information System (NFIS) databases at the PFC. Ultimately, this tool will benefit research and analysis endeavours within the public, private, and academic sectors, as well as contribute to the promotion of open and transparent access to government data (as per the Canadian governmentâ€™s directive on Open Government).</p>
          <p class="lead">The primary objective was to create a program that could take in a geographic tagged image file of a choropleth map and be able to identify the polygons on the map. These polygons would be extracted as a shapefile format for to be viewed and manipulated in geographic information system software. This program would provide a tool that reduces the time and resources required to convert a historical map to a workable map as vectorized spatial data. The program would introduce and utilize modern, open-source tools and frameworks that allow for enhanced research and analysis capabilities when working on relevant data.</p>
          <p class="lead">The Choropleth Map Segmentation (CMS) Tool initially began as a proof of concept to demonstrate image segmentation of choropleth maps using Python and open-source libraries for image processing and computer vision. After undergoing updates and iterative testing, the code now exists as a single Python script that runs via the command-line interface. The CMS Tool is designed to be platform-independent and easy to use, provided that the end-user has the knowledge, permission, and ability to set up the supporting environment. The CMS Tool accepts geoTIFF map files as input and converts the raster data (i.e. pixel-based image) in the map to shapefile format (i.e. vector-based images) using several image processing steps. This process is illustrated below. In figure 1. is an example of what the geoTIFF map file look like before segmentation. Figure 2. shows the output from our CMS tool.</p>

          <p class="lead">This project has created the perfect starting point for any additional work by utilizing open-source tools and passing forward all research documentation and logs. A future development team working with this project would be able to connect our existing program with an appropriate neural network (U-Net CNN, or Semantic Segmentation). The current program would create training data for the machine learning model by feeding in choropleth maps and extracting the most dominant values and features, and the machine learning model would train itself on this sample data in order to understand what it is the user is looking for in future maps.</p>

          <h2>SCRUM (Meetings)</h2>
          <p class="lead">For this project we used the SCRUM agile method. As part of the SCRUM methodology we had daily meetings to create a plan for the day and to keep each other informed about the progress we had made on our appointed tasks.  While an experienced SCRUM master would typically lead these meetings, each one of us rotated through the SCRUM master position to give each of us the opportunity to get some experience in the role and some new perspectives.</p>

          <h2>Weekly Status Reports</h2>
          <p class="lead">Each week we filled and submitted a weekly status report to our instructors at Camosun College. These reports helped to track our progress and to communicate what we had accomplished each week. This helped to ensure that there were no unforeseen issues or suprises in our workflow, and to ensure that we were on track to complete the project by its deadline.</p>
